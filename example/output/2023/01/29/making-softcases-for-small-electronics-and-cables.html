  <p>Wraps are my favorite way of storing small electronics. Whenever I get a new one
I'll probably make one really quickly to store it and it's accessories.</p>
<p>It's a fairly straightforward process. Start with a piece of cloth. I really
like this one, where it's like felt on one side and like linen on the other. It
makes it so the interior is really nice and soft.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll start by measuring the device I'll be wrapping. Once I've got the
measurements I'll lay my cloth on the floor and draw a rough rectangle. It'll be
a bit wider than needed and about four times the length of the device. This will
let me wrap it comfortably a couple of times.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll then cut this rectangle off.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I'll then fold a third of this cloth on top of itself and sew it. I got a free
sewing machine a while back (all it took was a couple of 3d printed replacement
parts to get it working but that's a story for another day) which I use for
this.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Once that's done I'll flip it inside-out and sew any open borders to give it a
cleaner look.</p>
<p>I'll also sew a elastic on the open side so I can close it up.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am not great a sewing.</p>
<p>I'll then place the device inside, wrap it up and figure out where to put a
button so that it closes up cleanly.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Buttons are hard. I'll do as many passes as possible because I really suck at
place them. Just doing a lot of passes will usually yield a nice looking result.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>It's all about confidence. Once it's all done, you can insert the device in and
wrap it, using the elastic as a latch.</p>
