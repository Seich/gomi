  <p>I was lucky enough to be gifted an old, broken guitar.</p>
<p></p>
<p>It was in pretty rough shape. The bridge had been bolted to the body so when it
started lifting it broke through the top.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I felt that it wasn't really worth restoring it and that I'd rather try building
something new on top of it. I was thinking that just adding a pickup would make
it a bit more interesting.</p>
<p>I started by removing half of the top. Since I don't care too much about the
quality, I was able to remove the lower half quite easily with a utility knife.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>I used this lower half to create a template to create a new lower half.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I used this template to cut a thin sheet of plywood to replace that piece. It's
a bit oversized but I will be sanding it down to size.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The new plywood was a bit thicker than the rest of the top so I had to plane the
outer wall down so that both parts would be somewhat flush together.</p>
<h2>January 22nd</h2>
<p>Here's the not-so-fun part. I started prepping the guitar for painting. I am
thinking I want to paint the entire thing in a solid color, a dark one should
make the entire thing easier to match.</p>
<p>I started with the body. I needed to make sure all edges were as neat as
possible. There's an upper bound to how good I think I can get it to look so I
am trying to cover the basics at least.</p>
<p>I didn't have a chisel on hand so I had to use a utility knife. It made the
process rather slow but I got it done.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After cleaning the edges, I sanded the body.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next I had to do the neck and fittings. I started by removing the old fittings,
I don't intend to buy new ones so I'll have to clean these.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Luckily disassembly is pretty straightforward.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Next I prepped the neck. Some light sanding...</p>
<p></p>
<p>and some light scrapping...</p>
<p></p>
<p>and it was ready to be painted.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We applied a primer, to hopefully even everything out a bit.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Now it only needs a second coat of primer and we'll apply it's final color.</p>
<h2>January 24</h2>
<p>In the meantime, I've gone ahead and cleaned up it's original hardware. I left
it all submerged in a cup with 1 part of distilled white vinegar and 1 part
water overnight.</p>
<p>The next day I had a go at it with a scotch pad and some steel wool under
running water.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After letting it dry and having it reassembled, it all looked great.</p>
<p></p>
