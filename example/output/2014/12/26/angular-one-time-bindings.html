  <p>This week I discovered One-way bindings in Angular.</p>
<p>Angular's one-way bindings are a great way to improve your app's performance. Here's what the documentation says about them:</p>
<p>This means that by using them, once the value is not undefined, the bound value is removed from the watch list and thus isn't processed anymore during the digest cycle.</p>
<p>
The syntax is pretty straight forward and very easy to use. All you have to do is prepend <code>::</code> before the value in the binding like this: <code>{{ ::user.name }}</code>. Once the value is set to the user's name, it won't be watched for changes anymore.
</p>
<p>Great, huh?</p>
<p>You can use them as part of expressions and directives as well so, go crazy!</p>
