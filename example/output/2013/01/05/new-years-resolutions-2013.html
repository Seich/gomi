  <p>I'll begin by saying this will be a great year. I have a lot of objectives and things I want to accomplish. Some will be the culmination of past efforts and some are new things I want to get done. My first resolution is to blog more. I've been saying I'll start blogging more often for a couple of years now and I keep failing. I'll change that and thus, my first objective is to write 52 posts this year, one per week. Since I don't alway have too much time I am not requiring myself to publish every week as long as I get it done eventually. I also will write small random stuff most of the time since, that's how I roll.</p>
<p>My second resolution is to start a company. I am currently participating in contest sponsored by my university. If I were to win I'd be established as a company in a couple of months. Even if this doesn't work out, I'll get started on my own.</p>
<p>There's more development and learning to be done in 2013 as well. I'd say 2012 was the year of Javascript. Working as a front-end developer forces you to learn a lot of Javascript so it's been a great experience. This year I'll further evolve as a Javascript developer but, I also want to master ruby. I just love that language and even though I've worked with it a lot I don't feel as confident in my skills. It still feels too magical for my taste. I'll be working a lot more on personal projects (and blogging about it as well). I already have one  android app in mind and a couple of gems to make my life easier.</p>
<p>In the end I hope this year is as great as the last one and I learn, develop and grow a lot more.</p>
