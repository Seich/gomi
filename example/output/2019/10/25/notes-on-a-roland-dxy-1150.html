  <p>I recently acquired a second plotter to complement my HP-7475A. I've been meaning to get an XY plotter so that I can use taller pens without modifying the case of my hp plotter. These Roland plotters are both beautiful and very functional so I've been waiting for a nice looking one to show up on my feed. It finally did.</p>

<h2>The Power Supply</h2>
<p>I overpaid quite a bit for it but it was what I wanted so I figured it was worth it. It was about $150.00 without a power supply. A word of warning, DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE WITHOUT A POWERSUPPLY. I am not the first person to say this but I decided to ignore that advice. I was lucky to find a power supply for it for an additional $30. All in all I ended up paying a bit over $200 for it (don't get me started on how much it was to ship it to Honduras). If you are looking for a power supply the model number is <code>DCP-302A</code>. It is a dual voltage power supply with one rail providing 31V 0.7A DC and another providing 9.7V 0.7A DC.</p>

<h2>Communicating With The Plotter</h2>
<p>Luckily this plotter has two different ports, which makes communicating with it very convenient. The serial port is fairly straightforward to use so I went with it. Turns out getting a USB to Serial adapter in Honduras was a bit harder than I expected. I did end up finding a DB9 USB to Serial adapter. The plotter has a DB25 serial port so that was only half of it. Luckily my plotter came with a PS/2 to DB25 cable I could sacrifice to make an adapter.</p>

<p>My DB9 USB to Serial adapter was male so I bought one of these DB-9 female adapters to replace the PS/2 end of my cable with.</p>

<p>Luckily Roland tells us what pin goes where in their user manual so setting it up was fairly easy.</p>
<p><img src="/files/2019-10-25-notes-on-a-roland-dxy-1150/pinout.jpg" alt="Roland&#x27;s pinout chart as shown in the user manual"></p>
<p>Here's how I wired it:</p>
<p>| DB25 Pin | DB9 Pin      |
| :------- | :----------- |
| FG (1)   | Sleeve (GND) |
| TXD (2)  | RXD (2)      |
| RXD (3)  | TXD (3)      |
| DTR (20) | DTR (4)      |
| SG (7)   | GND (5)      |</p>
<p>Make sure that the TXD goes into the RXD and the RXD into the TXD. It might seem obvious but I got it wrong the first time. Luckily these solder-less DB9 plugs are easy to reconfigure.</p>
<p><img src="/files/2019-10-25-notes-on-a-roland-dxy-1150/final-cable.jpg" alt="How all the cables looked like when done"></p>
<p>That was pretty much it, I plugged everything in and it all came together.</p>
<p><img src="/files/2019-10-25-notes-on-a-roland-dxy-1150/cables-connected.jpg" alt="How the connection between the DB25 to DB9 adapter and the USB to serial adapter looked like"></p>
<h2>DIP Switches</h2>
<p>The dip switches are fairly straight forward, I just kept everything off. So just change everything as you need it. I'd recommend changing one at a time. Coolterm managed to connect to it without any special settings. Baudrate 9600, Databits 8, Parity None, Stop Bits 1, DTR and RTS ON.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>This plotter was surprisingly easy to setup. Its worked almost entirely out of the box. Had I bought the correct adapter from the start it would have been a 5 minute affair rather than an hour long one.</p>
