  <p>Ok, so what’s up dear readers? I’ve been up to a bunch of random things lately so I’ll write them down just so I know what I was up to at this time of year later on.</p>
<p>First of all, I got a new job. I guess I’ll stop freelancing for the time being and focus on my new (awesome) job. Starting 2 weeks ago, I’ll be working as a “Graphic Developer” for the HNSC, which, is a fancy way to say I am a front end developer. I get to play with lots of javascript and are surrounded by amazing people I didn’t even know about! So yes, lots of new people and cool projects which might actually inspire me to build new and cool things on my own.</p>
<p>Second, I’ve been getting into javascript a lot lately. Like a serious lot. Even before my new job, I started reading and developing almost exclusively in javascript. I feel like I’ve been improving a lot constantly these past couple of weeks and am really happy about it. I’ve read and develop a lot, trying to get my vanilla javascript up to speed and I’ve been working with a lot of jQuery at work as well so that’s that. Today I built a jQuery plugin which, doesn’t do much but it’s exactly what I needed I’ll talk more about it once I figure out if I can release it as open source. That’ll hopefully happen soon.</p>
<p>Third, since I recently started working as a frontend developer, which is almost completely opposite from my old freelancing stuff where I focused on the backend, I decided to start a pears repository of stuff I use often just to keep mental notes and to share with you guys. You can find them here: http://patterns.martianwabbit.com/</p>
<p>And I guess that’s basically it, school is as hard as usual, I am still pretty dumb and I get paid to program for 4 hours on a daily basis, I am doing pretty good these days.</p>
