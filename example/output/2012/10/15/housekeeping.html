  <p>Hello world! It's that time of the year again where I am forced to do a little house keeping. My blog has been incredibly hideous for a couple of months now and I finally got the opportunity to do somethign about it.</p>
<p>I've redesigned it and, since apparently I am terrible at designing stuff I went with a very minimalistic approach. So my new blog is easier on the eyes, simpler and, will now become my homepage.</p>
<p>There isn't much to it, I'll be moving a couple of my old posts over to the new blog and I'll do my best to start blogging at least twice a week. It's actually harder said than done...</p>
<p>The blog runs on Jekyll now, mostly because it is hacker friendlier than tumblr and I love the idea of version controlled blogging. I will also remove comments from the blog since they distract me quite often. If anyone feels the need to tell me anything they are free to email me.</p>
