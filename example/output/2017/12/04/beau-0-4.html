  <p>Beau 0.4 is here! It includes some small goodies for ya'll. Mainly focusing on two things this time.</p>
<p>First, Beau now allows you to define requests in one line. If you pass a string as a configuration value it'll be taken as that request's alias so, you can get those small repetitive requests out of the way ASAP.</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">GET /users/:
  alias: get-users

GET /user/$get-users.body.0.userId:
  alias: get-user-0
</code></pre>
<p>Becomes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-yaml">    GET /users/: get-users
    GET /user/$get-users.body.0.userId: get-user-0
</code></pre>
<p>Much nicer.</p>
<p>The second change is the addition of a couple of extra flags to Beau's CLI: <code>--clean-request</code> and <code>--clean-list</code> . These print results for request and list without any formatting. This is mostly to make it easy to integrate Beau with other tools.</p>
<p>Speaking of other tools I am releasing a very-much in beta <a href="https://github.com/Seich/sublime-beau">plugin for sublime</a> .</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seich/sublime-beau/master/files/demo.gif" alt="Beau for Sublime demo"></p>
<p>The plugin allows you to make requests right from the Beau config file you are currently editing. There are several improvements I am currently working on which should be released soon. You can install it by using package control in sublime and searching for "Beau". Any feedback is welcome at the plugin's repository: <a href="https://github.com/Seich/sublime-beau/issues">https://github.com/Seich/sublime-beau/issues</a> .</p>
<p>That's it for now, I am working towards releasing a more polished release before the year ends if I get the time. I have lots of new and nice things planned for Beau in the near future.</p>
